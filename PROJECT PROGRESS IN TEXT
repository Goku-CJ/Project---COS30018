CURRENT PROGRESS OF OUR PROJECT :

1. FIXED LOCATION ROUTES
2. FIXED NUMBER OF DELIVERIES AND VEHICLE
3. SEARCH OPTIMIZATION FOR EFFICIENT ROUTES : ECLIDEAN DISTANCE MATRIX CALCULATION
4. OUTPUT OF EFFICIENT ROUTES PER EACH VEHICLE AND DELIVERIES.

FAULTS IN OUR PROJECT :

1. LOCATIONS AND NUMBER OF DELIVERIES SHOULD BE IN A READABLE FILE FOR THE PROGRAM - Doneâœ…
2. EFFICIENT ROUTES SHOULD BE CALCULATED WITH MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DELIVERIES THAT CAN BE DONE
3. CAPACITY OF EACH VEHICLE SHOULDE BE INSERTED
4. GUI FOR THE PROGRAM

QUESTIONS WE HAVE :

1.DOES OUR OWN SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ONLY CREATE THE BEST ROUTE FOR THE DA?
2.ARE WE GOING TO USE REAL ADDRESSES FOR THE PROGRAM OR LOCATION COORDINATES?
3.HOW DOES THE COST CALCULATE FOR THE ROUTE?
